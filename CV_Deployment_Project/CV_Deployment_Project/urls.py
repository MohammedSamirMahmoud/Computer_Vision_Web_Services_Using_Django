'''
The last line is particularly important, since the MEDIA_URL is the path to the /media/ directory, 
which has all the image files (input and output), that the code will use. So itâ€™s impartant to have that URL configured 
so that the templates can find those images when passed from the backend. In other words, the /media/ directory is the 
link or shared space the links the backend and the front end.
